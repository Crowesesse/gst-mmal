/* Since we use upstream buffer allocation, components must agree on the number
   of buffers used between them.  This is dictated by the requirement that the
   number of buffers sent to MMAL port must not exceed the number of buffer
   declared (`buffer_num`) when the port is enabled.  GPU needs to know how many
   buffers to prepare for the port on its side.

   If the number of buffers sent to the port exceeds `buffer_num`, we get
   ENOMEM.
