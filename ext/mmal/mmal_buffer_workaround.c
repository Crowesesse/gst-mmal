/**
 * These are overrides of functions provided by mmal library.
 *
 * They are overridden here because the original implementation does not take
 * care to handle the refcount in a thread-safe way, so we can (and do!) end-up
 * with the wrong refcount in threaded environment, and particularly in SMP case
 * as with RPi2.
 * 
 * This can easily lead to buffer headers being leaked and the pipeline
 * eventually grinding to a halt due to buffer starvation.
 *
 * This implementation uses atomic operations to manipulate the refcount.
 * We are able to override these functions because the dynamic-linker will pick
 * symbols defined locally in this library in preference to any that are defined
 * in a library it depends on.
 *
 * This is admittedly a somewhat dirty solution to the problem, but alternatives
 * such as wrapping these functions with others that take a big mutex lock are
 * also less than ideal. Plus these functions are anyway called by other mmal
 * functions.
 *
 * To be strictly correct, we should also take care of the functions:
 * mmal_pool_initialise_buffer_headers() and mmal_pool_buffer_header_release()
 * which also set the buffer header refcount.  However, in practice we have a
 * memory barrier between these operations and aquire()/release() manipulations
 * of the refcount, due to other mutex locking, and, due to the usage pattern,
 * the scope for racing with these functions is very small. So as we don't want
 * this dirty fix to become big-and-dirty, we do not re-implement those
 * functions here.
 *
 * Ideally, rpi-userland implementation would be patched upstream, so we can
 * delete this workaround.
